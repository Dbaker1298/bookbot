# bookbot
### BookBot is a very small Python program.

- We process the text from [Project Gutenberg's Frankenstein, by Mary
Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt) and generate a count of words in the text.
- We then filter, sort, and count the number of occurrences of each
alpha-character (converted to lowercase and only [a-z]).
- Finally, we print a report to `stdout`.
